    <h1>what is this project?</h1>
    <p>
      this is a historical archive of a file format in silent hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      right now, it just contains every model (.mdl) file in silent hill 2 restless dreams (pc).
    </p>
    <p>
      these source files are not easy to read; they are mazes of binary, made specifically for konami.
      each model here has been reverse-engineered from scratch.</p>
    <p>the goal of this effort is to preserve knowledge of these models and how they work, forever.</p>
    <h1>how do i use it?</h1>
    <p>
      use the "next file" and "previous file" buttons in the data controls to find a file you like.
      move the camera around by dragging on the screen.
      on a computer, try pressing <kbd>k</kbd> to see the keyboard controls.
    </p>
    <p>play around with the different options and explore the museum!</p>
    <h1>is it finished?</h1>
    <p>
      no, there is still a lot of mystery. i would absolutely love if you can contribute
      on <a href="https://github.com/laura-a-n-n/silent-hill-museum">github</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>what features are planned?</h1>
    <p>
      a future goal is to enable editing of the mdl format, so you can import
      edited assets into the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      another goal is to add more file formats, including maps and animations,
      and formats for other games in the silent hill series.
    </p>
    <h1>how does it work?</h1>
    <p>
      it parses the mdl files directly in your browser and renders them using
      the <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> library.
    </p>
    <p>
      i've documented the vast majority of the mdl file format by representing it in
      <a href="https://kaitai.io">kaitai struct</a>, a declarative binary parsing
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      the ksy file is compiled into a javascript parser and typescript definitions,
      allowing the kaitai js runtime to bring this theater to you.
    </p>
    <h1>how can i explore the mdl format further?</h1>
    <p>
      one way is to use the <a href="https://ide.kaitai.io/">kaitai ide</a>.
      upload the
      <a href="https://github.com/laura-a-n-n/silent-hill-museum/blob/main/ksy/mdl.ksy">ksy file</a>
      to the ide, and also drag & drop your favorite mdl file in.
    </p>
    <p>
      alternatively, if you're ok using typescript, i recommend downloading
      the repo and checking out how
      <a href="https://github.com/laura-a-n-n/silent-hill-museum/blob/main/src/model.ts">model.ts</a>
      works.
    </p>

    <p>do not.</p>

    <p>
      right now, it's just me, <a href="https://github.com/laura-a-n-n">laura ann</a>.
      but i couldn't have done this without the efforts of some people on the internet,
      whose resources have been invaluable:

        <a href="https://github.com/Quaker762">quaker762</a>

        a repository containing the dwarf debug symbols of silent hill 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        quaker762 also published an initial

        which is a really excellent texture extractor for silent hill 2.
        pretty much all the work done on textures here is directly from them.

          addon</a>
        for both ps2 and pc models! he helped me fix the normals as of v0.1.10. also, murugo has
        reversed the blendshape data in models, as well as the animation and shadow formats!

        when importing, be sure to select "temperance" for the "bone dir" dropdown.

        in material settings, be sure to set the blend mode for any transparent parts
